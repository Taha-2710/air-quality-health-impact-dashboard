# 🌍 Air Quality & Health Impact Dashboard (2019–2024)

## 📌 Objective
This interactive Tableau dashboard explores the relationship between **air pollution**, **weather conditions**, and **public health** across 8 major cities globally.

## 📊 KPIs Tracked:
- 🌡️ Average AQI
- 🏥 Hospital Admissions (per city)
- 🏗️ Hospital Capacity
- ⚠️ Top Contributing Pollutant

## 🔍 Key Analytical Questions:
- Which pollutants affect health most?
- How does AQI evolve from 2019 to 2024?
- Are hospitals prepared for pollution-related surges?
- Do rural or urban zones face higher health burdens?
- How do climate conditions amplify health risks?

## 💡 Insights Uncovered:
- **PM10** and **NO₂** are top culprits across most cities.
- **Cairo and Delhi** face high admissions but are close to or exceeding hospital capacity.
- **Urban areas** consistently report higher health strain.
- **AQI** dropped post-2020 but **spiked again in 2024**.
