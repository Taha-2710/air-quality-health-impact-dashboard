## 📊 Key Insights

### 1️⃣ Which pollutants affect health most?
PM10 and NO₂ showed stronger alignment with hospital admissions than O₃ or PM2.5.

### 2️⃣ AQI Change Over Time
AQI declined from 2020 to 2023 but rose again in 2024, indicating possible reversal in policy or urbanization effects.

### 3️⃣ Urban vs Suburban Health Burden
Urban areas report higher hospital admissions. Cairo’s rural data is an outlier—highlighting regional disparity.

### 4️⃣ Hospital Readiness
Cities like Cairo and Delhi show high admissions but limited hospital capacity.

### 5️⃣ Climate & Health
Heat and humidity combined with AQI intensify hospital loads—especially in Tokyo, Cairo, and Delhi.
